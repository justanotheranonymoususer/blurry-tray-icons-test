# blurry-tray-icons-test

I have a bug which causes the tray icon to become blurry on DPI change. I don't know how to fix it, but I know it happens starting from Windows 11 22H2, where the tray icons handling changed. There are other limitations with the new implementation, such as the inability to handle middle click.

See demos below. I set an icon with the size of each variant to easily see when the icon is blurry and scaled.

## Windows 11 22H2: worked properly
